# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Gemini AI Clone

Gemini AI Clone is a web application built using React and Vite, integrated with a generative API. This project aims to replicate the functionality and design of Gemini.
The application utilizes modern web technologies to create a responsive and interactive user interface, mimicking the look and feel of the original Gemini platform.

## Features

- **React Components:**
  - Implements various React components to create a modular and scalable UI structure.
  - Utilizes React hooks for state management and functional components for enhanced performance.

- **Vite Build Tool:**
  - Uses Vite as the build tool for fast and efficient development and production builds.
  - Enables hot module replacement (HMR) for real-time updates during development.

- **Generative API Integration:**
  - Integrates a generative API to generate mock data and simulate dynamic content.
  - Fetches data from the API to populate the UI with realistic information.

- **HTML and CSS Styling:**
  - Implements HTML and CSS to structure and style the user interface.
  - Utilizes CSS features like flexbox, grid layout, and media queries for responsive design.
